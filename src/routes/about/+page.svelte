  <p>hi! i'm aditya, thanks for stopping by :&#41;</p>
  <p>
    i'm a (former) student currently based out of toronto, canada, which is
    where i spent the latter half of growing up.
  </p>
  <p>
    i recently graduated from umass amherst with a bachelor of science degree in
    computer science (plus a minor in biology) and am at the moment searching
    for a full-time software engineering role.
  </p>

  <p>when i was in school, you could have caught me:</p>
  <ul class="list-outside list-disc">
    <li>
      holding office hours as an undergraduate course assistant for cs198C
    </li>
    <li>responding to 4am fire alarms as a resident assistant</li>
    <li>tripping over my two left feet on the ballroom dance team</li>
    <li>having the liveliest debates at product management club</li>
    <li>stargazing with the astronomy club</li>
    <li>...to name a few</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    i've always been an avid photographer, i enjoy building computers and
    keyboards, video games, music, fashion, running, cooking, and i retain far
    too much knowledge about star wars lore than should be allowed.
  </p>

  <p>
    i've been really enjoying reading about transit, infrastructure and city
    design, i've been perusing a <a

      href="https://theurbangeographer.wordpress.com/">couple</a
    >
    <a class="font-bold" href="https://spacing.ca">blogs</a> (both by fellow canadians!)
    recently, and i usually have a couple wikipedia pages up on my phone at any given
    time. i have far too many interests to really keep track of, but these should
    about cover the gamut.
