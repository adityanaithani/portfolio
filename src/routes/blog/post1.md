...so i've been meaning to put a personal website together since high school. thanks to maybe one of the greatest feats of procrastination ever, i only started working on it the summer after i graduated college.

i guess it's better late than never.

## motivation

## tech stack

i built this using **svelte** and **tailwindcss**, deployed through **vercel**.
i've used react and vue in the past, but i like how svelte handles routing in comparison to the other two.
having an entirely new file extension for what is mostly vanilla html is a bit odd, but i'll take it.

the blog portion of this site uses **mdsvex**, which lets me write markdown that's treated as just another component by svelte, which is pretty cool. there was a small amount of configuration involved, but i'd gladly take the ~30 minutes over having to write blogs in html forever.

this was also my first time using **tailwindcss**, which i used to oppose on the grounds that i was simply better for writing pure css. i don't know if i've completely changed my mind on that, but i will concede it's a lot faster and easier to get things up and running with tailwind, and i'll probably be using it in the future.

i did admittedly go the lazy route using **vercel** for deployment, but man it was sooo easy. i'm used to "one click" really meaning twenty, but this was literally one, maybe two clicks. i'm a fan. i will come back and update this if i get slapped with a massive bill in the future, but at least in the site's infancy, i can't complain.

finally - not at all coincidentally, svelte was taught in a web development class at umass (CS 426 at time of writing, but that may have changed by the time you read this), which i took my first semester senior year of college. i'm a big proponent of the concept that we're all mosaics of the people we spend time with, so i guess i have my professor of two semesters and boss of four, tim richards, to thank for this site being svelte instead of the react or nextjs it could have been.

## design

<!-- having a website reflect the essence of who i am as a person is a big ask, but as it evolves i hope it starts off at a decent enough place.

keeping this in mind, a few things i wanted to at least suggest were:

- star wars
- the colour green
- outdoor retailer design vibes
- somehow cross photog artsy + cs techy + whimsy green -->

## future plans

- photo gallery (coming soon!)
- project gallery (coming soon!)
- actually implement list styling
